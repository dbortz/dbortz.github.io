# 2007 Subaru Impreza WRX

## About

My wife and I are the original owners, and bought this car in May 2007, with the intention of it being my last fun car before diving into parenthood. Well, it somehow ended up being just practical enough to carry us through 8 years of childhood (not to mention serving as an outlet for a few minutes of fun between diaper changes). But now our children are older and bigger, and it's time to replace our beloved WRX.  

The car has been very well maintained, and we have all maintenance records available.  While we have certainly enjoyed some spirited driving, the car has never been raced, modified, nor taken off-road.  And although children in the back seat are pretty messy, goldfish crumbs cause no permanant damage.  There are a handful of scratches and small dings on the exterior, and a few on the interior, as well, but I like to think it's in pretty nice condition for its age.
